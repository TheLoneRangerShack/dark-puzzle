A fun little puzzle for Dark nerds.
(And a way for me to teach myself some React.)

## Setup
Copy .htaccess from public_html to redirect from port 80 to nextjs's 8081

To see running server: `./node_modules/forever/bin/forever list`

To start it again: `nohup ./node_modules/forever/bin/forever -c "npm start" ./ &`
